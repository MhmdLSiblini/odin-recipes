        <h4>ASSEMBLY</h4>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <h4>CRUST</h4>
        <li>In separate containers, freeze flour and butter until cold, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a large food processor, pulse flour, granulated sugar, and salt until combined. Add butter and pulse until pea-sized and some slightly larger pieces form. With the motor running, stream in vinegar, then ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until dough starts to come together and is moist but not wet and sticky (test by squeezing with your fingers). Mixture will be crumbly.</li>
        <li>Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface. Divide into 2 pieces, then flatten to disks (making sure there are no/minimal cracks).</li>
        <li>Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until dough is very cold, at least 2 hours or up to overnight.</li>
        <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll 1 piece into a 12" circle. Carefully wrap dough around rolling pin and unfurl into a 9" pie dish. Lift edges and allow dough to slump down into dish (don’t stretch). Refrigerate 30 minutes or freeze 10 minutes.</li>
        <h4>FILLING</h4>
        <li>In a large bowl, toss apples, granulated sugar, flour, lemon juice, cinnamon, vanilla, and salt until well combined.</li>
        <li>Transfer apple mixture to prepared pie dish. Dot all over with butter.</li>
        <h4>ASSEMBLY</h4>
        <li>Place a rack in center of oven; preheat to 425º. Place a large baking sheet on rack to preheat.</li>
        <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll out second disc of dough into a 12" circle and drape over apple filling. Trim overhang to an even 1". Fold overhang up and over itself and crimp edges. </li>
        <li>In a small bowl, mix egg with water. Brush dough with egg wash. Cut 5 to 6 small slits in the center. Sprinkle with coarse sugar.</li>
        <li>Place pie dish on preheated sheet and bake 20 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 375º and continue to bake, covering with foil if edges look dark, until crust is golden brown and filling is bubbly, about 40 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Transfer pie dish to a wire rack. Let cool at least 2 hours before serving.</li>
    </ol>
